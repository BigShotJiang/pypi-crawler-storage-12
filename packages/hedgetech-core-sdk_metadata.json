Limitation of Liability.\n        \n              In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including\n              negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law\n              (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,\n              shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any\n              direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n              character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or\n              inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for\n              loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or\n              any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such\n              Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n        \n           9.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of\n              any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and\n              hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims\n              asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such\n              warranty or additional liability.\n        \n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n        \n           Copyright 2025 HedgeTech\n           Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0\n        ",
