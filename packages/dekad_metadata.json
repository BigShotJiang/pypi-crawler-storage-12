Limitation of Liability: LICENSEE SHALL HOLD LICENSOR HARMLESS AGAINST ANY\n        AND ALL CLAIMS, DEBTS, DUES, LIABILITIES, LIENS, CAUSES OF ACTION, DEMANDS,\n        OBLIGATIONS, DISPUTES, DAMAGES, LOSSES, EXPENSES, ATTORNEYS’ FEES, COSTS,\n        LIABILITIES, AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE WHATSOEVER, WHETHER\n        KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, ANTICIPATED OR UNANTICIPATED, FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN, ACCRUED\n        OR UNACCRUED, DISCLOSED OR UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO LICENSEE’S\n        USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

Violations of Ethical Standards or Breaching Duty of Care: If Licensee\n        violates the Ethical Standards section or Licensee, or any other person or\n        entity within the Supply Chain prior to a good or service reaching the Licensee,\n        breaches its Duty of Care to Supply Chain Impacted Parties, Licensee must remedy\n        the violation or harm caused by Licensee within 30 days of being notified of the\n        violation or harm. If Licensee fails to remedy the violation or harm within 30\n        days, all rights in the Software granted to Licensee by License will be null and\n        void as between Licensor and Licensee.\n        \n        7.2. Failure of Notice: If any person or entity notifies Licensee in writing\n        that Licensee has not complied with the Notice section of this License, Licensee\n        can keep this License by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days\n        after the notice of noncompliance. If Licensee does not do so, Licensee’s\n        License (and all rights licensed hereunder) will end immediately.\n        \n        7.3. Judicial Findings: In the event Licensee is found by a civil, criminal,\n        administrative, or other court of competent jurisdiction, or some other\n        adjudicating body with legal authority, to have committed actions which are in\n        violation of the Ethical Standards or Supply Chain Impacted Party sections of\n        this License, all rights granted to Licensee by this License will terminate\n        immediately.\n        \n        7.4.

Additional Remedies: Termination of the License by failing to remedy harms\n        in no way prevents Licensor or Supply Chain Impacted Party from seeking\n        appropriate remedies at law or in equity.\n        \n        8. MISCELLANEOUS:\n        \n        8.1. Conditions: Sections 3, 4.1, 5.1, 5.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 are\n        conditions of the rights granted to Licensee in the License.\n        \n        8.2.
